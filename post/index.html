      My personal top #1 tip for using the ubiquitous command line utility top is to press i when you have launched it. It will help you to see much more than before by eliminating idle processes.
Pressing i helps a lot, because most of the time you start top to monitor processes which are putting (a lot) of load on your system and not for watching idle processes doing nothing.

      I always felt a bit disappointed with most 3D printable smartphone and tablet stands out there. Many have the wrong measures or are too big or too floppy, hence i decided to create my own. Being mostly a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; of 3D designs, i had little to no experience in what i learned is called &ldquo;solid modeling&rdquo;. Still i am quite happy about the results, so i decided to share the model.

      Do you know what an awesome-list is?
I am not talking about a shopping list, the movie Schindler's List or a piece of code with an array consisting of the names from all pok√©mon.
I am talking about a best practice for naming community-curated lists of valuable things on the internet. If this sounds like a bookmark list to you, you're right. It is the same as a well-kept bookmark list for a certain topics, but with more than only one contributor and usually a strict policy for contributions to ensure constant quality.

      I prepared some slides and a bit of demo code to demonstrate the python debugger pdb and how to work with this tool.
This is meant to be a hands-on session at my local python user group meetup in Frankfurt am Main at wednesday night.
I just learned that debugging with the help of an interactive tool instead of investing the time to write unit tests or just trying to form a better mental model of the code at hand seem to be a controversial debate amongst developers nowadays.

      I love my X100T digital camera and i have been looking for a battery case to be a bit more organized. Turns out: There is none you can buy.
I always wanted to design something useful which can be 3D-printed, so i made some designs and about a dozen test prints to get the dimensions right (not too tight, not to loose). I also made some stacked variants.
Hopefully it is useful for some people, you can grab them at thingiverse.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      A nice way to compare two (or more) files on different servers with vimdiff - which is just an alias for vim -d file1 file2 filex - works like that:
$&gt; vimdiff scp://remotehost//path/to/file1 scp://remotehost//path/to/file2 scp://remotehost//path/to/file3  Of course you can also compare files on localhost:
$&gt; vimdiff ./file1 scp://remotehost//path/to/file2 scp://remotehost//path/to/file3  Actually vimdiff is also a great difftool in tandem with git and other (D)VCS when you like to use the command line a lot.

After a few years and reading books like David Allen's Getting things done i spent lots of time and some ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ on productivity tools.

        3D printed safety razor

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      About this posting I'm into safety razors and i'm also enthusiastic about 3D printing. A few days ago i stumbled upon this model of a safety razor from a user called H3R0M4T3 and printed it using ordinary white PLA and not expecting too much.
The result after my first shave: I like this homebrew razor very much. It gives a very close shave and the razor itself can be positioned in various ways along the plate before it is compressed by the top cap which gives you either the same blade configuration on both or a quite aggressive blade on one side and a more gently blade on the other side.
