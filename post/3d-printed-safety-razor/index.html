<p>I'm into safety razors and i'm also enthusiastic about 3D printing. A few days ago i stumbled upon this <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763815">model of a safety razor</a> from a user called <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/H3R0M4T3/about">H3R0M4T3</a> and printed it using ordinary white PLA and not expecting too much.</p>
<p>The result after my first shave: I like this homebrew razor <em>very</em> much. It gives a very close shave and the razor itself can be positioned in various ways along the plate before it is compressed by the top cap which gives you either the same blade configuration on both or a quite aggressive blade on one side and a more gently blade on the other side. I can compare these razors to my Pils, Merkur and Feather safety razors which are all great commercially available razors. Yet again: I am impressed!</p>
<p>The only downside is the comb, which is very big and it is hard to shave right under the nostrils. Of course  this is a shortcoming which can be fixed quite easily by doing a remix of the original 3D model.</p>
