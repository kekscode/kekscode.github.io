    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>My personal top #1 tip for using the ubiquitous command line utility <code>top</code> is to press <code>i</code> when you have launched it. It will help you to see much more than before by eliminating idle processes.</p>
<p>Pressing <code>i</code> helps a lot, because most of the time you start top to monitor processes which are putting (a lot) of load on your system and not for watching idle processes doing nothing.</p>
<p>It is also useful to dig into top and learn more about it! It is much nicer than you may have thought.</p>
<p>For example: It can print the full commandlines of the software you're running by hitting <code>c</code>. It can also show you the activity of all your CPU cores by pressing <code>1</code> and you can instantly see if a process claims only one of them or if it is taking advantage of multiple cores. It can also show you a &ldquo;forrest view&rdquo; by pressing <code>V</code> including all parent and child processes nicely visualized.</p>
<p>Top has a text configuration file <code>.toprc</code> which can persist every interactive change you did. This allows you to set your personal prefered view by pressing <code>W</code> after some filtering. The next time you start top, it will remember you and present all the filters and formattings you have been adding in the last session.</p>
<p>I hope this was helpful.</p>
