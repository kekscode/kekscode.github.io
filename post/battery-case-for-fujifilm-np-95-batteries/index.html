<meta property="og:description" content="I love my X100T digital camera and i have been looking for a battery case to be a bit more organized. Turns out: There is none you can buy.
I always wanted to design something useful which can be 3D-printed, so i made some designs and about a dozen test prints to get the dimensions right (not too tight, not to loose). I also made some stacked variants.
Hopefully it is useful for some people, you can grab them at thingiverse." />
