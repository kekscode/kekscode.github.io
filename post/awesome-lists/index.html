<p>I am not talking about a shopping list, the movie <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/424-schindler-s-list" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a> or a piece of code with an array consisting of the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pokemon/blob/master/data/en.json" title="pokémon names">names from all pokémon</a>.</p>
<p>I am talking about a best practice for naming community-curated lists of valuable things on the internet. If this sounds like a bookmark list to you, you're right. It is the same as a well-kept bookmark list for a certain topics, but with more than only one contributor and usually a strict policy for contributions to ensure constant quality.</p>
<p>As far as i know this has started on Github a few years ago with <a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python" title="awesome-python">awesome-python</a> and a few years later there are so many of these lists, that <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresorhus</a> started a *meta-*list of awesome lists called <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome" title="awesome lists meta list">awesome</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these lists also have their own websites with different &ldquo;frontends&rdquo; which is usually some HTML and JavaScript goodness for faster scrolling, searching and navigating.</p>
<p>Coming from search technology it struck me that there should be a search engine which federates all these lists. As it turns out there is already such a thing called <a href="https://awesomelists.top" title="search through awesome lists">awesomelists.top</a> which looks like it may be really helpful to wade through this little universe of awesomeness ;-)</p>
